For NGS processing we need fastq files and a samplesheet.

- CASE1 :: download from SRA
  - input file is list of sra ids
  - download from sra and make samplesheet
  - paths in output sample sheet are absolute compute environmnet
  - outputDir will contain sample sheet and fastq files
- CASE2 :: local fastq files
  - input file has samplesheet header and one or more columns for names of fastq files (but relative paths only)
  - paths in output sample sheet will be abosolute paths on cluster
  - outputDir will contain output sample sheet
  - NOTE:  the sample sheet with relative paths may be ok?  but for consitency we make a new samplesheet with abolute paths
