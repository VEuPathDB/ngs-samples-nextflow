For NGS processing we need fastq files and a samplesheet.

- CASE1 :: download from SRA
  - input file is nf core samplesheet format
  - SRA ID is found in "fastq1" column
  - download from sra and make new samplesheet
  - paths in output samplesheet are absolute compute environment
  - outputDir will contain sample sheet and fastq files
- CASE2 :: local fastq files
  - input file is nf core samplesheet format
  - values in samplesheet will be relative paths  (typically in same directory as samplesheet)
  - paths in output sample sheet will be absolute for compute environment
  - outputDir will contain output sample sheet
